# **RRT Path Planning with Obstacle Avoidance**

This project implements the **Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT)** algorithm for path planning on a 2D map with obstacles. The implementation supports **real-time visualization** and modular components for map processing and pathfinding.

## **Features**

- **Path Planning**  
  Implements the RRT algorithm for navigating from a start position to a goal while avoiding obstacles.

- **Map Processing**  
  Converts grayscale `.pgm` or `.png` map images into binary configuration spaces for planning.

- **Visualization**  
  Real-time visualization of the RRT algorithm's progress using `matplotlib`.

- **Extensibility**  
  Modular code structure allows easy integration of other algorithms or map representations.

- **Data Handling**  
  Saves map and configuration data as `.npy` files for efficient computation.
